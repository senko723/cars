This repo contains a bash script named “cars.sh” that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars.
 
 The user will be presented with a menu of three options:
1.Enter a new car
..*Asks user seperately for the year,make, and model of the car
..*Formats these values into a single string and appends it to another file
2.Display the list of cars
..*Uses "sort" command to display the lines of the file in orderd based on year
3.Quit and exit the program
..*Echos a "Goodbye" message
..*Breaks out of the while loop
